Project 2 - CRUD Application with additional functionality

## Introduction

The expectations for this project is to implement a new CRUD application, but include additional functionality into it that was not covered in the standard lessons.
With this expectation in mind, this is the project application I will be developing:

### CRUD App: Bird Watching Application:

**MVP for application:**
* Birds models
* User models - basic user & admin user
* Index pages for birds, user's collection, & admin super user page
* User page to request bird addition to model
* User pages to add, update, delete their unique bird collection data
* Admin create, delete, & update bird in model; ability to delete users
* Landing Page that includes sign-up & sign-in routes
* Sign-up & sign-in Authentication pages and routes (utilizing regular expressions)
* Updated Landing Page based on user authentication

**Stretch:**
* Admin ability to access user's model data and make adjustments
* Comments, likes, and # of users that have seen bird that users can see in full bird index page
* Ability for users to see other user bird collections anonymously

---

My expectation is to cover the following applications that were not covered:
* Application of MVC in Express for CRUD application to better maintain and manage the code
* Utilization of regular expressions
* Utilizing Authentication and Authorization that will create unique user and admin sessions in application
* Utilizing Mongoose Relationships to embed and/or reference the models and sub-databases

Here is my anticipated work breakdown:

* Level ups on Authentication and Mongoose Relationships
* Build initial structure of application in VS code
* Build & test CRUD MVP: add, edits, & deletion of birds
* Build Authentication for User profiles
* Finalize MVP logic
* Stretch goals: customer orders models
* Start stretch goals: customer orders & error catching, randomization
* Finalize stretch with user score tracker & review code for project presentations
* Project Delivery and Presentation

## Initial Progress

I began with the completion of the content on Authentication and Mongoose embedding and referencing objective.  I then began with the initial file structure and build of the application, creating the basic file structure and the models to utilize in this application.  This will be the first push in GitHub to start the project off.
